Hello there! My name is Michael, a 19-year-old fullstack developer based in the United Kingdom. My area of expertise lies in website development, and I am presently pursuing Computer Science studies at the university level. I primarily work with PHP but am also diving into languages such as Rust, Go Lang and C++.
